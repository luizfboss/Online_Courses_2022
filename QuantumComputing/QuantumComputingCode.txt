Use the IBM Quantum Lab

qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
1 - number oif qubits


add gate:
qc.x(0)
x - type of gate
0 - first qubit

add gates to circuit:
qc.draw() -> no parameters
qc - name of quantum circuit
draw - function that draws the circuit
This code will return an image of the circuit as an output

visualize transition(qc, trace = True)
This is going to run the curcuit using this code. At the end of the code, a video and a picture will show up showing the process
